Make Me A Video Game!

I the funny and lazy James have ran Jack's scary sister and plan to steal her smart gun!

What are a bear and backpacking ant to do? Before you can help Cindy, you'll have to collect the dark fins and stormy night that open up the 30 worlds connected to A JB's Lair. There are 13 mountains and 4 rivers in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
